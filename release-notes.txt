   VERSION HISTORY
#####################

V1.05 12/21/2025
   Because PoLo does not include MY_GRIDSQUARE field when in pure chase or hunt mode,
   I've added a -c directive after the file to add or edit that with whatever the default_mygridsquare.
   This works just like the -f directive when used after the source file name but runs the 
   default_output_file_name through the modification program again and outputs the chase file 
   to the default_chase_file_name.  Think of this as a two pass action.
   
V1.04 12/19/2025
   Added help command -h
   See pdf for full documentation

V1.03 12/12/2025
   Created some default variables to make this easier to change.
   I like putting the output file in a place that is easy for aclog.
   Putting a -f anywhere will assume defaults for all following parameters

V1.02 
   If you pass "-f" as the output file name, it goes into full override mode, setting default values for
   output_file, field_value, field_name, and it skips the comformation step at the end and just executes.
   This version does not allow the input and output files to be the same

v1.01
   Fixed an issue where reading assumed uft-8 files would crash or it was just the large file.
