   VERSION HISTORY
#####################

V1.04 12/19/2025
   Added help command -h
   See pdf for full documentation

V1.03 12/12/2025
   Created some default variables to make this easier to change.
   I like putting the output file in a place that is easy for aclog.
   Putting a -f anywhere will assume defaults for all following parameters

V1.02 
   If you pass "-f" as the output file name, it goes into full override mode, setting default values for
   output_file, field_value, field_name, and it skips the comformation step at the end and just executes.
   This version does not allow the input and output files to be the same

v1.01
   Fixed an issue where reading assumed uft-8 files would crash or it was just the large file.
