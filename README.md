This script will modify ADIF (Amateur Data Interchange Format) files used for exchanging data between most amateur radio (ham radio) logging programs.
Use Cases
I use a portable logging app on my phone and iPad to log contacts for POTA, SOTA, CHASING, CONTESTing.  I also use contesting apps for various contests.  Once the mission is complete, I export from the logging app to ADIF file format.  In preparation for importing to my main logging program, “Amateur Contact Log” (ACLOG) developed by N4JFP.  I use the ADIF file editor to quickly add a field with the activity name as the value.  The field name is a user customizable field in ACLOG, called “OTHER”  (Yes, at the time, I had no imagination).  
The program can be used to add or edit ANY field in the ADIF.  

See associated documentation pdf for description and usage.

If you run the program without any parameters, it will prompt you for each value.
